# split
A c++ function returning a splitted vector based on a given string and separator.
Split.cpp is the de facto splitting program, giving us a function to be used outside it. Main.cpp is just an example source file, you can originate the split from. It's included just for testing purposes. A header file and necessary imports are included to decrease time needed for the program to set up.
I mainly use this if I'm developing something in c++ at my school, or any other foreign workspace and need such algorithm.
